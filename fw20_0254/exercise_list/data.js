Hold this position briefly and make sure you have complete control of the bar. Now raise the bar up to the starting postion.  Return the bar to the rack after you've completed your set.",
        "tips": "The width of your grip on the bar will change the focus of the bench press. A medium grip is most common. This is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. It's usually marked on the bar.  Having a spotter to help you with the bench press is essential. A competitive, motivating spotter is one of the most valuable assets you can find.  Choose a weight that is challenging and allows you to maintain proper form. Improper form is less effective and could result in an injury. Use a slow controlled motion and never lock your elbows.",
